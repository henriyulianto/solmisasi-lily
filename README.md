This repository contains my workarounds on engraving ***solmisasi*** / ***not angka*** numbered musical notation (widely used in Indonesia), instead of standard musical notation, using the mighty [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org). 

This software would always be in **beta phase**, as some extra works might have to be done in engraving such a specific score or sheet music in this format.

### What is *solmisasi* (EN: solmization)?
*Solmisasi* (*not angka*) refered here is a musical notation system to represent *solf√®ge* in numbers. It is quite similar to Chinese *Jianpu* system. 
In my country (Indonesia), *solmisasi* takes the form of 1 to 7 for "do re mi fa sol la si", and 0 for rests, with some convenstions as listed below:
- Sharpened notes are written by putting "/" (upward slash) over the notes' number.
- Flattened notes are written by putting "\" (downward backslash) over the notes' number. 
- Single dot above a specific number is used to represent an octave higher note.
- Single dot below a specific number is used to represent an octave lower note.
