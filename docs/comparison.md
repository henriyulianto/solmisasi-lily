title: Standard (Western) vs Solmisasi

People say: _"A picture is worth a thousand words"_. Let's bring up some pictures here to better show the differences (and implicitly, the equivalencies) between both notation systems.<br>
  Just take a seat, and relax!

## Pitches in C Major
{: .text-delta .fs-6 }

In this example, let's take a reference from what Wikipedia says: [Vocal range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_range). Please take a note that the ranges given below are approximations and are not meant to be too rigidly applied.<br>
Notes: There are 2 solmisasi sub-staves below the standard male vocal staves: (Actual) and (Real World). The pitch numbers on (Actual) are the 'actual' pitch numbers converted from the standard notation pitches, while the ones on (Real World0) are the 'real-world' pitch numbers that the solmisasi system applied in vocal music. Using the same Lilypond music passages/sequences, it can be achieved by setting a custom staff context property named `male-vocal` to `##t` (true).
